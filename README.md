# scala-js-pixi

[Scala-js](https://www.scala-js.org/) 
[facade](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/interoperability/facade-types.html)
for
[PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) (v4).

Pixi is an awesome framework for 2D rendering on canvas, using either webgl
or canvas-2d rendering.

This facade allow you to use Pixi from Scala
with Scala-js.

The facade is far from complete. However, adding
missing pieces according to your needs should be
straightforward.

## Documentation

The 
[PixiJS documentation](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html)
is great and there is nothing to be added to it
from here. Source files point to the relevant
documentation web page.
